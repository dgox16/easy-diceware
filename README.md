EasyDiceware is a project created with the purpose of sharing the method I use to generate my passwords. For its development, I combined ReactJS and Laravel technologies to create a friendly and simple interface, while managing the complexity with a well-established framework.

The word lists come from sources that ensure improved entropy, resulting in passwords that are harder to crack, without increasing, as much as possible, the complexity of the generated words. Additionally, you can arrange the words from this page however you prefer.

The code is completely open for adaptations, and you can find a button in the top bar to access the project's repository.
